## Research Purpose

This research seeks to answer the following question: Are age, political beliefs, and prior flu shot associated with the intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine for adults in the United States?

## Vaccine Intention & Flu Shot History

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
covid.small <- covid.small %>% 
  mutate(vaccine.intention = recode_factor(vaccine.intention,
    "Don't Know/Not sure" = "Unsure Intent to get Covid Vaccine",
    "No" = "No Intent to get Covid Vaccine (No)",
    "Yes" = "Intent to get Covid Vaccine (Yes)",
  ))

#Figure 1 - Flu Shot History Graphed with Percent in Intention to get COVID-19 Vaccine
figure1 <- covid.small %>% 
  drop_na(vaccine.intention, flu.shot.history) %>% 
  group_by(vaccine.intention, flu.shot.history) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(vaccine.intention) %>% 
  mutate(percent = 100*(n/sum(n))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flu.shot.history, fill = vaccine.intention,
             y = percent)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18, base_family = 'serif') + 
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#eff3ff")) +
  labs(x = "Have you received a flu shot\nin the past 12 months?", 
       y = "Percent in vaccine intention group",
       title = "Figure 1: Vaccine Intention & Flu Shot History\n(2022; n = 511)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1b9e77", "#d95f02", "#7570b3"), 
                    guide = "none") +

figure1
```

```{r include = FALSE}
descr::CrossTable(x = covid.small$flu.shot.history,
                  y = covid.small$vaccine.intention,
                  sresid = TRUE,
                  expected = TRUE,
                  prop.r = FALSE,
                  prop.c = FALSE,
                  prop.t = FALSE,
                  chisq = TRUE)
# assumptions met, expected values are large in all cells
```

-   There is a statistically significant association between vaccine intention and flu shot history ($\chi^2$ = 56.35; p \< .05)
    -   Significantly **fewer than expected** people who had a flu shot did not intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine (std res = -3.30) and **more than expected** who had a flu shot intended to take the vaccine (std res = 2.87)
    -   Significantly **more than expected** people with no flu shot did not intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine (std res = 4.44) and **fewer than expected** with no flu shot intended to take the vaccine (std res = -3.87)

## Vaccine Intention & Political Beliefs

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=7}
#Figure 3 - Political Beliefs Graphed with Percent in Intention to get COVID-19 Vaccine
figure3 <- covid.small %>% 
  drop_na(vaccine.intention, political.beliefs) %>% 
  group_by(vaccine.intention, political.beliefs) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(vaccine.intention) %>% 
  mutate(percent = 100*(n/sum(n))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = political.beliefs, fill = vaccine.intention,
             y = percent)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18, base_family = 'serif') + 
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#eff3ff")) + 
  labs(x = "Political beliefs", 
       y = "Percent in vaccine intention group",
       title = "Figure 2: Vaccine Intention &\nPolitical Beliefs (2022; n = 511)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1b9e77", "#d95f02", "#7570b3"),
                    guide = "none") +
  facet_wrap(facets = 'vaccine.intention', nrow = 3)
figure3
```

```{r include = FALSE}
descr::CrossTable(x = covid.small$political.beliefs,
                  y = covid.small$vaccine.intention,
                  sresid = TRUE,
                  expected = TRUE,
                  prop.r = FALSE,
                  prop.c = FALSE,
                  prop.t = FALSE,
                  chisq = TRUE)
# assumptions are met, expected values are large in all cells
```

-   I found a statistically significant association between vaccine intention and political beliefs ($\chi^2$ = 142.55; p \< .05).
    -   Significantly **more very liberal people than expected were intending to take the COVID-19 vaccine** (std res = 4.83) while **significantly fewer than expected** who preferred not to answer, were politically mixed, or were somewhat conservative were intending to take the vaccine (std res \< -2)
    -   Significantly **more than expected** people who preferred not to answer, were politically mixed, or were very conservative were not intending to take the COVID-19 vaccine (std res \> 2) while **significantly fewer than expected** who were very liberal or somewhat liberal were intending to not take the vaccine (std res \< -2)

## Vaccine Intention & Age

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gghalves)
figure4 <- covid.small %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = fct_rev(vaccine.intention),
             y = age.years,
             x = vaccine.intention)) +
  geom_half_violin(aes(fill = fct_rev(vaccine.intention)), alpha = .4, side = "r") +
  geom_half_point(aes(color = fct_rev(vaccine.intention)), alpha = .8, side = "l") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18, base_family = 'serif') + 
  labs(y = "Age in Years", 
       x = "Intent to Get Covid Vaccine",
       title = "Figure 3: Vaccine Intention & Age in Years\n(2022; n = 511)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1b9e77", "#d95f02", "#7570b3"),
                    guide = "none") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#1b9e77", "#d95f02", "#7570b3"),
                    guide = "none") +
  scale_x_discrete(
    labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 15),
    drop = FALSE
  ) +
  coord_flip()
  
figure4
```

```{r include = FALSE}
# fails the assumption of normal distribution within groups, the Yes group is very right skewed
# the don't know group is somewhat right skewed
# Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal.test(formula = age.years ~ vaccine.intention,
             data = covid.small)
# stat sig so do follow-up test
dunn.test::dunn.test(x = covid.small$age.years,
                     g = covid.small$vaccine.intention,
                     method = "bonferroni")

```

-   There was a statistically significant difference in age distribution across the vaccine intention groups (KW $\chi^2$ = 11.63; p = .003)
    -   The mean age of the group with no intention to vaccinate for COVID-19 was statistically significantly higher (diff = 3.35 years) compared to the group that intended to vaccinate for COVID-19 (p = .001)

### Summary and Recommendations

I found that people who had a flu vaccination in the last year, had more liberal political beliefs, and were younger were more likely to intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine [@rasul2023; @ruiz2021; @albrecht2022]. Increasing the uptake of flu vaccination and developing health communication campaigns that reach older and more conservative audiences could both increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.
